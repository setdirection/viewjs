A DOM centric class and inheritence system for jQuery.

- most id="whatever" in HTML is for jQuery to reference
- jQuery View removes the need to write markup for the sake of identifaction in the code
- jQuery View allows more meaningful connections between DOM elements and your data model
- passing a View instance to jQuery is the same as passing the View instance's element to jQuery
